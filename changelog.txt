Version 1.1 (1st September 2013)
---------

 - Now supports double pattern sizes: up to 32 notes per pattern instead of 16.
 - Added global effects (delay, chorus, distortion, a bunch more!)

LITTLE THINGS:

 - Long notes stop playing when you start and stop the track.
 - Support for different window sizes (x1, x2, x3 etc)

 - Escape key quits.
 - Added program icon.
 
BUGS:
 
 - BPM now set correctly when creating new song / loading a song with a different BPM.
 - Copying columns works properly now.
 - Fixed fullscreen setting bug. Should remember fullscreen/window settings.
